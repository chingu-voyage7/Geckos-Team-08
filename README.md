A Highly Customizable App for Taking Notes

## Alex's Fork

I have added some basic firebase functionality, where you can add and see notes.

I will add more functionality as time goes on.

To see this in action, you can take a look at this app [live](https://geckos-note-app.firebaseapp.com).

Also note that the file required to run this locally is a firebase specific file that has private info, so I have opted to gitignore.
